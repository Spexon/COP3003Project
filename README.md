# COP3003Project

This project will use information learned from one of my previous projects (Procedural Project) and add new features to it in java.
I will be using an H2 database to store information such as production log and employee accounts instead of a cpp file. Instead of the user interface being console driven, I will create my interface oriented around GUI using JavaFX.
